- Meaningful constructors
- Meaningful methods
    - ✅ isEmpty hardcoded function
    - ✅ hardcoded print function
    - getPosition is hardcoded
- ✅ Remove mines from board
- ✅ getBoard isn't covered 
- make game status strings a global constants
- long printed format is difficult to understand
- remove Board from minefield.test.js
- size.rows and size.columns in minefield are hardcoded
- minefield.getNeighbouringBombCount needs to be more DRY
- minefield.getPosition and minefield.getNeighbouringBombCount have high cyclomatic-complexity
